## Task 1 – Landing Page Redesign (Rapido)

As part of my UI/UX design internship, I was assigned the task of redesigning the landing page of the Rapido website. The objective was to enhance the visual appeal, improve user experience and modernize the interface while maintaining the brand’s identity and core functionality.

The original landing page was informative but visually inconsistent. It used a mix of real-life images and icons, lacked clear visual hierarchy and had uneven spacing. My goal was to create a more user-friendly, aesthetically modern, and visually cohesive layout that enhances both usability and accessibility.

In the redesigned version, I introduced a modular grid structure for better readability and flow. I replaced real images with clean vector illustrations to maintain a consistent and modern visual tone. Key sections like the hero area, service categories, earning opportunities and app download prompts were restructured for clarity and impact.

Typography and color usage were also refined—applying consistent font sizing, spacing and brand-appropriate color schemes. All call-to-action buttons were made more prominent with uniform styling to guide user interactions effectively. The footer was simplified and reorganized to improve navigation and visual balance.

The redesign was also created with responsiveness and accessibility in mind. I ensured that the layout adapts smoothly across devices and that all text, buttons and visuals meet accessibility standards.

This task allowed me to apply core UI/UX principles such as hierarchy, alignment, spacing, consistency and responsiveness to a real-world product, focusing on delivering a clean, intuitive and engaging experience for users.
